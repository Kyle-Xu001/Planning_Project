Task Division

Task1: World Building, Simulation, Map.
Guy: Chenghao
1st, generate a hardcoded static environment (so that other team mates can test their algorithms)
2nd, generate a randomizer i.e.  given some input parameters (complexity of map 0,1 value), generate maps that have reachable paths from start to goal.
3rd, transfer this code to ROS
